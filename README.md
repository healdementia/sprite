# Autosprite!

Do you like SVG? Then you should be using sprites pretty often!
Make sprites automatically with the help of Gulp!

- step #1:
make sure you have npm and Gulp installed on your machine

- step #2:
open Terminal, enter the folder of this repository and run `npm install`

- step #3:
once everything is installed, place all SVG pics you'd like to make a sprite from into the subfolder named "icons"

- step #4:
run `gulp sprite`

- step #5:
in a few secs check the main folder of the repository - there should be a newly-fledged file called `sprite.svg`
